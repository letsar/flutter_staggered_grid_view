/// A scrollable, 2D array of widgets with variable sizes.
///
/// The main axis direction of a grid is the direction in which it scrolls (the
/// [scrollDirection]).
///
/// The most commonly used grid layouts are [StaggeredGridView.count], which
/// creates a layout with a fixed number of tiles in the cross axis, and
/// [StaggeredGridView.extent], which creates a layout with tiles that have a maximum
/// cross-axis extent. A custom [SliverStaggeredGridDelegate] can produce an
/// arbitrary 2D arrangement of children.
///
/// To create a grid with a large (or infinite) number of children, use the
/// [StaggeredGridView.builder] constructor with either a
/// [SliverStaggeredGridDelegateWithFixedCrossAxisCount] or a
/// [SliverStaggeredGridDelegateWithMaxCrossAxisExtent] for the [gridDelegate].
/// You can also use the [StaggeredGridView.countBuilder] or
/// [StaggeredGridView.extentBuilder] constructors.
///
/// To use a custom [SliverVariableSizeChildDelegate], use [StaggeredGridView.custom].
///
/// To create a linear array of children, use a [ListView].
///
/// To control the initial scroll offset of the scroll view, provide a
/// [controller] with its [ScrollController.initialScrollOffset] property set.
///
/// ### Sample code
///
/// Here are two brief snippets showing a [StaggeredGridView] and its equivalent using
/// [CustomScrollView]:
///
/// ```dart
/// StaggeredGridView.count(
///   primary: false,
///   crossAxisCount: 4,

///     const Text('4'),
///     const Text('5'),
///     const Text('6'),
///     const Text('7'),
///     const Text('8'),
///   ],
///   staggeredTiles: const <StaggeredTile>[
///     const StaggeredTile.count(2, 2),
///     const StaggeredTile.count(2, 1),
///     const StaggeredTile.count(2, 2),
